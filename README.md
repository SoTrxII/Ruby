## Does it work ?
Sometimes, yes. 

## What does it do ?
Playing fucking music John, you jackass.

There are two main way of making it work. Either in "classical mode" with a discord CLI, or via a Web GUI.
In the Web version, you can play multiple tracks at the same time ! 

### Classical mode
Just use ```$add [YOUTUBE_URL] ``` to add a track in the playlist. The song will be automatically played.
The playback volume can be controlled with ```$volume [0-100]```. Song can be skipped using ```$skip```.

### GUI mode
By using ```$io``` in the discord chat, a playlist is created.
